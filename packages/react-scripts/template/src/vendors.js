// This file controls which npm packages are extracted into a vendor bundle.
// A vendor bundle is very useful for reducing your transmitted bundle size,
// as dependencies which rarely change can be cached while you iterate on your
// application.

// If you want to add another vendor, just add in this array the name of the
// npm package.

module.exports = ['react', 'react-dom'];

// You can delete this file if you'd prefer to not make a vendor bundle.
